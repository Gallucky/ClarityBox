## How to Use This Folder

1. Add new files to the appropriate folder based on their category.
2. Use descriptive file names with versions, e.g., `component_card_sketch_v1.drawio`.
3. Keep a `README.md` inside subfolders for detailed notes if needed.
4. Do **not** include sensitive information (`.env` or API keys). Use templates instead.
5. If you have an idea that doesn’t fit yet, place it in `00_misc` and move it later.
