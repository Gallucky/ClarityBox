# ClarityBox - Tracking Updates Branch

This branch is used **exclusively** for automated tracking and documentation updates. It is **not** intended for manual development or feature work.

## Purpose

-   Stores the latest `Changelog.md` and `Todo.md` generated by automation.
-   Keeps historical backups in the `.tracking` folder.
-   Provides a clean branch for workflow-driven pull requests to `main`.

## Notes

-   Do **not** commit unrelated changes to this branch.
-   All updates are generated automatically via the `Update Tracking Docs` workflow.
-   If you need to update code or other files, work in the `main` branch or feature branches.

## Structure

## Automation

-   The workflow runs on:
    -   Manual trigger (`workflow_dispatch`)
    -   Weekly schedule (only if there are open issues)
